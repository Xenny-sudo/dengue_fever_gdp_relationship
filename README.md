# Relationship between Dengue Fever & GDP($)
I wanted to perform an analysis of some topic to put skills that I learned in practice; I decided to do an analyis of Gross Domestic Product(GDP$) and a disease. I had to choose a disease and ultimately ended up choosing dengue fever due to its prevalence in my mother country of the Domincan Republic. The goal was to see if a higher GDP results in less dengue fever deaths.<br>
It's important to note that I'm neither an economist, biologist, or medical doctor; With that being said I have a basic understanding of economics and biology which I picked in college & high school AP courses.
## Gross Domestic Product(GDP$) 
As define by the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Back-to-Basics/gross-domestic-product-GDP#:~:text=GDP%20measures%20the%20monetary%20value,a%20quarter%20or%20a%20year).">International Monetary Fund</a> is "the measure of of all monetary value of final goods and services produced in a country in a given period of time." It is different from Gross National Product in that GDP only accounts for products made within the country and not products made abroad by companies of said country.
## Dengue Fever (DENV)
According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue">World Health Organization</a>, "dengue fever is a viral infection transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes". Something of note is that dengue is found in tropical/sub-tropical climates meaning a lot of countries with colder climates like Canada or Russia will have 0 deaths or infections.
